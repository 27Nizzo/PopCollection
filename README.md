# 🧸 PopCollection

**PopCollection** is a personal project built with **Next.js**, created as a modern, free, and user-friendly alternative to PopPriceGuide (PPG).

## 🚨 Motivation

PopPriceGuide has long been a go-to platform for **Funko Pop!** collectors, offering tools to organize and manage collections. However, over time, the site has moved key features behind a paywall — including something as basic as viewing your full collection.

As a long-time collector and user of PPG, this change was incredibly disappointing. Now, unless you pay for a premium subscription, you can only see the *top 10* items in your collection. That limitation sparked the creation of **PopCollection** — a free, open-source, and user-first platform built by a frustrated fan.

## 🎯 Goal

To create a platform where any Funko Pop! collector can:

- Add and organize their collection with ease  
- View their full collection with no restrictions  
- Track basic stats like estimated value, total items, etc.  
- Access the app from any device, fast and responsively  

No paywalls. No premium-only features. No nonsense.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

PopCollection is being developed with:

- **Next.js** – React-based framework for modern web apps  
- **TypeScript** – For better type safety and maintainability  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling for fast UI development  
- **Prisma ORM** (optional) – Database integration (e.g., PostgreSQL)  
- **NextAuth.js** – Simple and secure authentication (planned)  
- **Public API (TBD)** – To fetch estimated Pop! prices (under review)

## 📦 Planned Features

- [x] User authentication  
- [ ] Manual figure entry  
- [ ] Full collection view  
- [ ] Personalized stats dashboard  
- [ ] Search & filter (by name, number, category, etc.)
